## React Community Video Player
This is a project that is currently being built to allow for users to join
individual rooms and watch a video together in sync. The frontend is designed
and built using React while the Backend uses a simple express server. To help
the frontend and backend communicate, they both use Socket.IO to achieve this
goal.

#### How to Run?
Cd into the project root and run the command `docker-compose up`. You will need
to have both `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in order for this to work.

##### Version 0.2.0
 - Added Docker support
